## Manual Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide assumes your game already has core mods installed
>
> If it doesn't: open [BSManager](https://www.bsmanager.io), select the game version you want to mod, go to the Mods tab, and click __`Install or Update`__. Then, run your game once, go to the main menu, and close it. ℹ️*

1. Open [BSManager](https://www.bsmanager.io) and select the version of Beat Saber you want to install the mod to.
2. Click on the version options button at the top-right corner, then select __`Open Folder`__.
3. Download the desired mod from a trusted source, often found on community GitHub repositories. Search for the mod's name followed by "GitHub" in your search engine.
4. Installing Different Types of Mods:
    - __For mods that come as a single `.dll` file:__ If the mod consists of a single __`.dll`__ file, copy this file into the __`Plugins`__ folder in the directory you opened in step 2.

        > [!NOTE]
        >
        > Do __not__ place files in __`Beat Saber_Data\Plugins`__. If you do not see a __`Plugins`__ folder directly in the folder you opened in step 2, make sure you have core mods installed and have run your game at least once after installing mods.

    - __For mods that come as a `.zip` file:__ If the mod includes multiple files or folders, you need to maintain the provided folder structure. Double-click the zip file to open it, press __`CTRL+A`__ and then __`CTRL+C`__ to copy all files/folders inside the zip, go to the directory you opened in step 2, and press __`CTRL+V`__ to paste them there. Do __not__ paste them in any subfolder, such as __`Plugins`__ or __`Beat Saber_Data`__. If you are prompted to merge folders or overwrite files, click "Yes."

5. The mod should now be installed. Run Beat Saber to check if the mod functions correctly. If it doesn't, double-check that you:
    - Have all required dependencies installed. These are typically listed somewhere on the mod's release page.
    - Placed the mod in the correct install folder.
    - Downloaded a mod intended for your game version.
